"""
Example: Using use_spot with Strands Agent

This demonstrates how to integrate use_spot with a Strands agent using AWS Bedrock.

Requirements:
- AWS credentials configured (aws configure)
- Bedrock access with Claude model permissions
- Spot robot environment variables: SPOT_HOSTNAME, SPOT_USERNAME, SPOT_PASSWORD

Model Configuration:
- Uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 (anthropic.claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022-v2:0)
- This model supports on-demand throughput (no inference profile needed)
- For Claude 4.x models, you'll need to configure an inference profile in AWS Console

Robot Details:
- Hostname: {hostname}
- Available via use_spot tool

Your capabilities:
- Control robot movement (stand, sit, walk)
- Capture images from cameras
- Query robot state
- Manage power

Use the use_spot tool with service-method pattern:
- service: robot_command, robot_state, power, image, etc.
- method: stand, sit, get_robot_state, get_image_from_sources, etc.
- params: method-specific parameters

Always check response status before proceeding.
Be safe and deliberate with robot control commands.
